# Third-party components in the release packages

This repository's own code is licensed under the GNU AGPL v3 ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). The prebuilt packages on the
releases page also contain the components below, each under its own license. The packages' `licenses/` folder holds
the full license texts.

The CUDA runtime is NVIDIA's software and the Visual C++ runtime is Microsoft's; neither is covered by this project's
license. The model files are not part of the packages: they come from Unsloth's Hugging Face repository under the
model's own license.

Source code: each release is built from the tagged commit of this repository (the release page links its source
archive) and llama.cpp tag b10246 (https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/tree/b10246). `BUILD_INFO.txt` in each package
names the commit, the build flags and the toolchain.
